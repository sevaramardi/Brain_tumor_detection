The project focuses on improving the detection and classification of brain tumors—specifically meningioma, pituitary, and glioma—using MRI images. The study uses the YOLOv5m model as a baseline and enhances it by integrating an Enhanced Spatial Attention (ESA) layer, which improves the ability of the model to focus on important spatial features, leading to better detection accuracy.
Results: The study demonstrates that the ESA-enhanced model provides better performancein detecting and classifying brain tumors, showing improvements in precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP), especially in detecting meningioma and pituitary tumors.
